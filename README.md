## Motivation

I thought criminal justice would be an interesting topic to research, so I decided to start there. A question that I had that pertained to that subject was what age are typical of offenders.

## Data Process

When looking through data sets, the open policing data from Stanford University stuck out.  In the data each row represents a stop by police officers. It contains multiple data files from many different cities in the United States. This data can be found at https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ . For this Assignment I chose to use the data from Little Rock, Arkansas because it was a manageable size and had information that I was interested in. This data is all from the year 2017. When looking through the data I found that some ages were missing, so I decided to discard those rows.

## Visualization

I chose the histogram over other ways to represent the data because it would hard to read otherwise. With how many data points we have there would be too many things. This histogram shows the distribution of ages. It nicely shows how prevalent each age is. It is interesting how the histogram shows that most of the people stopped are from people who are in their twenties.

## Analysis

For this data I want to know how what ages are more prevalent, so I decided to use a boxplot to analyze the data.  I was also able to use R to find the mean value, the maximum value, and the minimum value. As a result, I found that the mean age is 33 years old, the youngest person was 14 years old, and the oldest was 99 years old. There were 97 outliers, which were all people over 80. Looking at the boxplot and the outliers, it’s interesting to see how much older people are stopped, even though it is not nearly as much as for those who are younger. I was definitely surprised to see that there were an entry for someone in their nineties. I was even more surprised when there was an entry for someone 99 years old.
